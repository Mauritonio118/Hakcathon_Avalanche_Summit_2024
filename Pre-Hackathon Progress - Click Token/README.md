# Pre-Hackathon Progress - Click Token

This repository contains the initial work developed in the three days leading up to the hackathon. The code in the folder corresponds to a conceptual frontend of what I planned to present for this competition.

The idea for Click Token emerged during the Aleph hackathon, in which I was unable to participate. However, I now have the opportunity to develop it in this hackathon.

You can view and test the project at the following link: [Click Token Demo](https://ideaclicktoken.v0.build/)

I appreciate your time and consideration in reviewing this pre-hackathon progress. I am excited to continue developing and improving this idea during the hackathon.
